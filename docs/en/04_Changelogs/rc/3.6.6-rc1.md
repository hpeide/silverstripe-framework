# 3.6.6-rc1

This security release removes the following file extensions from the default whitelist of accepted types for 
uploaded files: `dotm`, `potm`, `jar`, `css`, `js` and `xltm`.

If you require the ability to upload these file types in your projects, you will need to add them back in again.
For more information, see ["Limit the allowed file types"](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3/developer_guides/forms/field_types/uploadfield/#limit-the-allowed-filetypes).
